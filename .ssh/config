# Tips from: http://blogs.perl.org/users/smylers/2011/08/ssh-productivity-tips.html


# Connection sharing
# I believe %h is hostname and %p is port
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
ControlPersist yes

# Forward SSH agent
# allows connecting from one remote server to another
ForwardAgent yes

# Resilient connection: ignore short outages
# (If the connection hangs, it will resume working if the network reappears within 10 minutes)
TCPKeepAlive no
# This will send a "keep alive" signal to the server every 60 seconds
ServerAliveInterval 60
ServerAliveCountMax 10
# Additionally, to use AutoSSH, set the following environment variable:
# export AUTOSSH_PORT=0

# Run GUI programs on files on remote servers
ForwardX11 yes
# Note that the server needs to enable it
# with this line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
# X11Forwarding yes

# If connecting to a server sits there for a few seconds not doing anything,
# try adding this line:
# GSSAPIAuthentication no

# Hostname aliases
# check all the dawn machine numbers
